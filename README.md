# Lend-or-Lose
Training ML models to predict which individuals are at the highest risk of defaulting on their loans is essentially a binary classification problem, where the target variable is the likelihood of default. Several factors, as mentioned below, contribute to predicting whether an individual is likely to repay a loan or not, making this task a matter of differentiating between two possible outcomes: default (1) or no default (0).
